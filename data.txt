33 Days by Keenan: 
It's been 33 days
Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since I drove by your place
I was hoping and I'm prayin'
That one day you would change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't feel like I felt when I fell for you
And I don't and I won't say I miss you too
You had me feeling like I was the crazy one
Lies wrapped up 'til we came undone
Had love, gave love
But you gave me up
Fuck
You stole my heart
Then we grew apart
You charged my card up
You totaled my car
I dealt with all that shit
I never called it quits
Woke up one morning and then called and said all of this
(Hello)
It's been 33 days
Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since you begged me to stay
You told me it'd be different
And one day you would change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't need you, you, you
You had me, me, me, me
Fool me once(fool me once)
Twice(twice), three(three)
Now I see, see, see
I don't need you, you, you
You had me, me, me
Fool me once(fool me once)
Twice(twice), three(three)
So let me breath, please
